# Interest facts about me

My name is Zhoucheng Zhu, a MAPSS student in UChicago. I study **psychology**, yes, I know how to read your mind but I have sworn that I would never waste my power on mortals. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## My life

I was born in Shanghai, China in 1995, and I grew up in Shanghai, thanks to my parents for not changing their jobs so that I had a quite stable life. I spent my first two college years in *East China Normal University* in Shanghai, then I went to *Colorado State University* through a program called "2+2", which enabled me to get diplomas from both universities. **Colorado** is a beautiful place and a good place for visiting. Go to http://www.colorado.com/ to see what you can do in Colorado.

--------**Just kidding**--------

-I like watching movies, I am a big fan of Marvel superhero movies. Sometimes I also watch horror movies because they make me excited. 
-I also like playing guitar, I like country music. Tommy Emmanuel is my favorite guitarist. 
-I like playing basketball as well, but after I broke my ankle this Feburary, I am not playing as often as I was.


*PS*: I cannot read people's mind, don't worry.
