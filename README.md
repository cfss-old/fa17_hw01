#How I completed the assignment:
1. I initially set up an SSH in Terminal through bash and github by following the instructions provided by [github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-mac). 
2. I then forked from the assignment folder and cloned that folder to my desktop and opened it in RStudio. 
3. In RStudio, I opened the README.md by clicking on it in the file section and completed my edits in the box that opened in the top left part of the program.
4. Once there I filled in the document and used the coding directions I found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) so as to properly create my document.
5. Once the assignment was completed there I saved the RStudio project.
6. I then opened Terminal again and went to the 'hw01' directory. Once there I followed the directions found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) in order to push the documents from the local hw01 to the github equivalent.
