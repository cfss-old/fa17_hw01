## Homework 1 9-27

My name is Kristopher Nichols, I am 22 years old, and I love reading - my **favorite** author being Ernest Hemingway - and watching basketball. I am from Dallas, Texas and completed my undergraduate degree at [Stephen F. Austin State University](http://www.sfasu.edu/) with a major in psychology and a minor in French. I hope to apply to doctoral programs in behavioral science.

My favorite topics in psychology include: 

  * Cognitive Dissonance Theory
  * Morality
  * Religiosity!
