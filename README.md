A brief biography as a part of the homework:

## Zahra Amalia Syarifah
I was born in Indonesia and grew up there. However, shortly before my high school graduation I moved to the UK. *So I **never** actually completed high school*. I went straight to a college in Southeast England and moved to Scotland for my undergraduate. Now, I am completing my Master in the States.

For the sake of using the list. Here are the list of my favourite carbohydrates:
* Pasta
* Potato
* Bread

Here is an image of Hungarian Goulash (for the sake of the points, but also because it's one of my favourite dishes)

You might want to make it at home, so here is a recipe for it:

# Reporting Process
1. Using the forked and cloned version, I loaded README.md from the 'Files'.
2. After I made the changes I saved it.
3. README.md appeared under the 'Git' tab.
4. Then I clicked 'Pull'.
5. Then I selected 'README.md' and clicked 'Commit'.
6. After making notes and checking the changes, I clicked 'Commit' and 'Push'.

## Reflections
* It was a bit confusing at first as I have never used GitHub before, but after a while it started to make sense.
* Markdown was also a bit of pain as some components did not work in R console (the bullet points didn't work) but it worked in GitHub, so at some point I wasn't sure whether the bullet points worked. The image also failed to show up at my initial attempt. A lot of online tutorials were available on Google and they were super helpful.
* I was *this* close to giving up for the day. But I don't want to have any homework for the weekend, so I persisted. Hopefully this pain and blood is worth it.
* The bottom line is that it is super complicated but by practice (I hope) that it'll get easier or at least they'll make sense to me.
