Welcome to Alex Trahan's readme file.

# T. Alexander Trahan

*"He's one of the worst students we've got."*

#### Life Course:

Alex was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He completed his undergraduate studies in History and International Affairs at the University of Georgia in 2014. Before coming to the University of Chicago to begin his MA in International Relations, Alex spent a year as a research assistant with a San Francisco-based NGO focused on nuclear nonproliferation policy and nuclear disarmament advocacy. He misses the beautiful Bay Area views, but he certainly **does not** miss paying the Bay Area rent on non-profit pay. 

#### Research Interests

Alex's MA thesis project focuses on 'how and why' a former wartime enemy can be re-articulated as a legitimate political actor after the official cessation of military hostilities. Using archival evidence gathered from two presidential libraries and online sources, it explores US-Vietnam postwar relations as a case study of this phenomenon. Alex is interested in learning how computational methods can help him add empirical meat (and transparency) to his interpretive claims - for example, if one claims that Vietnam the country had to be distanced from the POW/MIA issue in US political discourse before reconciliation could take place in the mid-1990s, perhaps a computational analysis of a corpus of newspaper articles will support this claim. 

#### A few of his favorite things:
* Riding his bike around Hyde Park (and beyond)
* Thomas Pynchon's fiction, especially:
    + *Mason & Dixon*, and
    + *Inherent Vice* 
* The musical stylings of [Holy Sons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP7zBrV5pgY) and [Mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDjKC_DjsWo)
* Emil Amos's collages, especially the super goofy ones like this:
