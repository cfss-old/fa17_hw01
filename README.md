##Personal Background
* I was born in **Hangzhou**, Zhejiang, China in 1994. In the past, I need to explain it's a city near Shanghai, but now, I like to say it's the hometown of Jack Ma and Alibaba. 
* I'm a big fan of Japanese (pop) culture--I'm addicted to anime and Japanese TV drama. 
* I also play the bass (mostly jazz, sometimes also C-pop and J-pop/rock) and practice Kendo (just passed the *Bogu* examination). 
* I like reading detective novels, but I probably read more books published by University Presses.

##Education
* I'm a 1st-year PhD student in the **Department of Sociology** at the University of Chicago. 
* I graduated from UC Berkeley in the spring of 2017, with BA in sociology and Asian studies. 
    * I was the winner of departmental citation from both departments.
    * I served as a co-president of the Datong Society of China Studies at Berkeley in the 2015-16 academic year
    * I was also an editor of _Eleven: the Undergraduate Journal of Sociology_

##Research Interests
* With a background in sociology and Asian studies, I'm interested in producing what sociologist John Lie called **global knowledge**. For me, this means to revise "nomothetic" social theories that are actually based on western peculiarities by investigating other societies, such as China and Japan. Specifically, my research interests are:
    * Gender and masculinities
    * Culture and music
    * Social theory
    * Methodology
