## Classes
I this quarter, I am taking four courses: Analysis in Rn-1 (Real Analysis), Computing for Social Sciences, Empirical Analysis (PhD-level Econometrics), and Game Theory. The hardest course is Empirical Analysis, which is even 10 times harder than Real Analysis. I spend 70% of my time on studying Econometrics.
