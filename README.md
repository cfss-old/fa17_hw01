### Please allow me to introduce my self...

My name is Amine Sijilmassi, I am from **Morocco** and studied in **France** for several years. I am currently a student in MAPSS for academic year 2017-2018. 

I've travelled quite a lot, and here is a sample of the cities I've lived in : 

* Rabat
* Paris
* Lyon
* Barcelona

I don't have a blog or anything so if you're interested in contacting me please add me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/amine.sijilmassi) !

A little bonus : I am a fan of Lyon, a city in France which is less known than Paris.  I think it is too bad because it is a wonderful place to visit, so here is my chance to advertise it a little with the following photo :
