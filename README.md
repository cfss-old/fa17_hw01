Welcome to Alex Trahan's readme file.

# T. Alexander Trahan

*"He's one of the worst students we've got."*

#### Life Course:

Alex was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He completed his undergraduate studies in History and International Affairs at the University of Georgia in 2014. Before coming to the University of Chicago to begin his MA in International Relations, Alex spent a year as a research assistant with a San Francisco-based NGO focused on nuclear nonproliferation policy and nuclear disarmament advocacy. He misses the beautiful Bay Area views, but he certainly **does not** miss paying the Bay Area rent on non-profit pay. 

#### A few of his favorite things:
* Riding his bike around Hyde Park (and beyond)
* Thomas Pynchon's fiction, especially:
    + *Mason & Dixon*, and
    + *Inherent Vice* 
* The musical stylings of [Holy Sons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP7zBrV5pgY) and [Mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDjKC_DjsWo)
* Emil Amos's collages, especially the super goofy ones like this:
