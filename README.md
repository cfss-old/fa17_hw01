# Zeyang Yu's Self-introduction

## Basic Information
Hi, my name is *Zeyang Yu* (Arthur). I am a first year PhD student at Political Science department. I am interested in **political economy of development and institutions** and **political methodology**.

## Favorite Political Economists
I always follow my favorite political economists' research. My favorite political economists are:
1. James Robinson
1. Daron Acemoglu
1. Alberto Alesina
1. Torsten Persson
1. Guido Tabellini
1. Daniel Treisman
1. Ruixue Jia
1. James Kung

You can find James Robinson from his [personal website](http://scholar-harris.uchicago.edu/jamesrobinson/biocv).

## Classes
I this quarter, I am taking four courses: Analysis in Rn-1 (Real Analysis), Computing for Social Sciences, Empirical Analysis (PhD-level Econometrics), and Game Theory. The hardest course is Empirical Analysis, which is even 10 times harder than Real Analysis. I spend 70% of my time on studying Econometrics. However, I do think I've learned a lot from Econometrics class. And this one is so different from one I've taken before because it applies large sample theory.

## Process
1. Fork and clone file.
1. Made changes in my personal computer.
1. Commit change and push to Github.

## Reflections
1. The entire process is a bit confusing. But I spend some time on reading the course material and figure it out.
1. I first don't know how to insert image in Markdown file. Because the guidance is not very detailed.
1. I'm also struggling on creating html file.
