Welcome to Alex Trahan's readme file. Prepare to absorb his biographical information!

# T Alexander Trahan

*"He's one of the worst students we've got."*

####Life Course:

Alex was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1991. He  completed his undergraduate studies in History and International Affairs at the University of Georgia in 2014. Before coming to the University of Chicago to begin an MA with the Committee on International Relations, Alex spent a year as a research assistant with a San Francisco-based NGO focused on nuclear nonproliferation policy and disarmament advocacy. He misses all those beautiful Bay Area views, but he certainly **does not** miss paying that Bay Area rent on non-profit pay. 

#### A few of his favorite things:
* International politics^1^
* Riding his bike around Hyde Park and beyond
* Thomas Pynchon's ficion, especially:
    + *Mason & Dixon*, and
    + *Inherent Vice* 
* The musical stylings of [Holy Sons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP7zBrV5pgY) and [Mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP7zBrV5pgY)
* Emil Amos's digital collages, especially the super goofy ones like this:

1. That said, this is admittedly a pretty depressing time to be really into politics.
