### Bio
I am a third-year PhD in the department of **political science**. My research interests include American presidency, public opinion and the relationship between presidents and political parties. One of the projects that I am currently working on is about presidential partisan particularism, specifically the explanation why American presidents disproportionately allocate federal funds toward their co-partisan constituencies. I am also working on my dissertation prospectus, in a very embryonic stage, which tries to explore the presidents' public appeals by analyzing their speeches and international appeareances. Prior to settling down in Hyde Park, I earned my BA and MA in Tsinghua University, China. Beyond academic work, I have been a ballroom dancer for 9 years. I specialize in international standards and regularly compete in midwest area and some national ballroom dancing competitions.
