##Homework 1
###Rafael Cruz Gil

I am an archaeologist currently enrolled in **MAPSS**. I want to take this course in order to learn the tools to support my work with statistical methods.
Some of my interests are:

1. Middle Eastern Archaeology
  i) Roman Syria
  ii) Crusader Kingdoms
2. Economic Archaeology 
3. How different societies influence one another through trade or war.

I have mainly worked in the First Century Jewish settlement of Magdala (probably identified in ancient sources as *Migdal Nuniya*, "The Tower of the Fish"), in Israel. A link to a YouTube video showing the site can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKbXPJfJZI).
