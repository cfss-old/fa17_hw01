## Homework 1, Donghai Yu

+ My name is Donghai Yu. I am a graduate student in the Master's of Arts Program in Social Sciences (mapss). I went to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where Niagara Falls is. I didn't know until last year (my friends and I already felt tho), Buffalo is actually one of the best cities for ***Foodie*** [in this **World** link](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/food-cities/). Forget about the snow, forget about the lack of entertainment activies, food is the only thing matters.

+ Academically, I'm interested in the environmental history of modern China, and I plan to use both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine Chongqing area. 

+ My hoppy includes drawing, painting, jogging, workout, and above all, travel. Among the places I have had opporunity to visit, I would recommend anyone who enjoys nature landscape to travel to Gansu Province, China. The snow mountains and forest were truly magnificent.
