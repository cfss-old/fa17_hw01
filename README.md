Hi! I am Hyunku Kwon, a first year _MAPSS_ student. I was born in **South Korea**. I graduated from Yonsei University, where I majored in Public Policy and Political Science, with a special focus on political philosophy in general, and political liberalism and its critics in particular. I was an exchange student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. For the last two years, I served my military duty in South Korea. 

My research interest lies in
