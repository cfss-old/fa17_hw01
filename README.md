### 1. Life in Belgium
In the fall of 2015, I had the change to go to [**KU Leuven**](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) in Belgium for half a year. The life of an exchange student entailed the joy of independent living and learning. I also tried to learn a bit Dutch, but now Iâ€˜ve forgotten all about it.

### 2. 10-meter platform diving
I took a diving course during my last year in Tsinghua and sucessfully jumped from the **10-meter platform**. It's the most exciting experience that I have ever had.I don't know how could I come up with so much courage at that time...(*I am afraid of heights*)

### 3. Travelling more than 14 countries in half a year
When I was in Belgium, I took advantage of its superior geographical position and Schengen Visa, travelling around more than 14 countries. Countries included **France, Spain, Austria, Czech, German, Switzerland, Netherlands, Sweden and Danmark etc.**

### 4. Sports fan
I enjoy **long-distance races, volleyball and swimming**, and took part in many sports competitions during my undergraduate year. Recently, I develop great interets in *Yoga* and *Zumba* thanks to the FitChicago program.

### 5. Out of comfort zone
Frankly, I am a lit bit shy and **introvert**. I set a goal for myself in order to be comfortable in networking, which is making a least one new friend everyday.
