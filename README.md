## Zahra Amalia Syarifah
I was born in Indonesia and grew up there. However, shortly before my high school graduation I moved to the UK. *So I **never** actually completed high school*. I went straight to a college in Southeast England and moved to Scotland for my undergraduate. Now, I am completing my Master in the States.

For the sake of using the list. Here are the list of my favourite glutens:
* Pasta
* Potato
* Bread

Here is an image of Hungarian Goulash (for the sake of the points, but also because it's one of my favourite dishes)
