## Classes
I this quarter, I am taking four courses: Analysis in Rn-1 (Real Analysis), Computing for Social Sciences, Empirical Analysis (PhD-level Econometrics), and Game Theory. The hardest course is Empirical Analysis, which is even 10 times harder than Real Analysis. I spend 70% of my time on studying Econometrics. However, I do think I've learned a lot from Econometrics class. And this one is so different from one I've taken before because it applies large sample theory.

## Process
1. Fork and clone file.
1. Made changes in my personal computer.
1. Commit change and push to Github.

## Reflections
1. The entire process is a bit confusing. But I spend some time on reading the course material and figure it out.
