####Kai Feng
Hello, world! I am _**Kai**_ from MAPSS program focusing on sociology. I finished my undergrad in Shenzhen University in China. [**facebook link**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006609094638)

*Research interests
I am interested in social demography. My last research project studied the late marriage pattern in China. I want to explore the field of social network in the future. 

*More about myself
My dream is to become a demographer and find a research position in college. I enjoy the joy of cooking after I became a graduate student. Daily shopping and cooking save me from the pressure and stress.
