#Hello to the world of R!
I'm **Saniya**, an incoming MAPSS student at Uchicago.
I did my undergraduate from *LUMS* in Pakistan, where I majored in Economics and minored in History.
At Uchicago, I plan to:
* Study Economic History
* Using analytical computational skills
I love going to the beach and taking such pictures:
