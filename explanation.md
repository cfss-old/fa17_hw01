I initially set up an SSH in Terminal through bash and github by following the instructions provided by [github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-mac). 
I then forked from the assignment folder and cloned that folder to my desktop and opened it in RStudio. 
In RStudio, I opened the README.md by clicking on it in the file section and completed my edits in the box that opened in the top left part of the program.
Once there I filled in the document and used the coding directions I found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) so as to properly create my document.
Once the assignment was completed there I saved the RStudio project.
I then opened Terminal again and went to the 'hw01' directory. Once there I followed the directions found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) in order to push the documents from the local hw01 to the github equivalent.
